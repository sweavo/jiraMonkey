Testing.

1) Make sure your JIRA behaves badly in a predictable way.

Turn off user scripts.

In a Scrum project, go to plan view and click some backlog items. See the detail view appear. (Maybe you have to click the actual ticket ID where it actually looks like a hyperlink to do this; maybe on your JIRA instance it happens when you click anywhere in the ticket)
Go to work view and try the same. You are looking for a reliable way to make the plan view pop up.

2) Enable user scripts and reload JIRA.

Observe that the hide-detailed-view checkbox appeared.

3) Plan view simple test.

3.2 Hit T to hide detail view again. PASS
3.3 Click a second item to get detail view up. PASS
3.4 Check the hide-detailed-view checkbox and verify the detail view goes away. PASS
3.5 Click the first item to attempt to get the detail view up and verify that it does not appear. PASS
